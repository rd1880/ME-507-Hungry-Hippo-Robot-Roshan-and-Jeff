Hungry Hippos is a game where many participants are in a competition, and the goal is to collect as many marbles as you can
that were thrown out onto the arena. For the scope of this class, the goal is to engineer a highly functional and stable robot,
with feedback via color and light sensors to complete a task of collecting as many balls as you can and depositing into a goal. 
The catch is that there are different colored balls, and they are assigned to each team. Black lines cover the arena from the base 
to the center, and the line follower is meant to be used to follow then line and scoop up balls, using the color sensor as 
feedback to collect the properly assigned colored ball. This repository includes Goals Accomplished, BoM, PCB Design, proposed 
Mechanical design. Files included are for the master code, CAD Solidworks diagram, and Fusion 360 files. 




# Goals Accomplished
- Create a program that will act as a DeadMan's Switch for safe practices
- Create a program that will drive motors via motor controllers on PCB board
- Design, Fabricate, and Test a PCB Board with power circuitry, motor, and sensor control for Robot Design
- Create a program that will read a line follower sensor with feedback for determine white vs black lines
- Successfully implement tests for motors and sensors
- Learn how to use Fusion360 for PCB Design
- Learn a little bit of Solidworks
